# Git Existential

Do you ever feel like a meaningless speck in a maudlin universe? Is there truly a meaning to life or are all just a series of chemical reactions deterministically playing out in some grand simulation? This application certainly won't answer those questions, but you can at least see some commit message from authors who probably felt similarly at the time.

### Sources

All data was queried from [Google's Big Query service](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/). Query strings, such as `'what have i done'` and `'god help me'`, etc. were run against [github's public dataset](https://medium.com/google-cloud/github-on-bigquery-analyze-all-the-code-b3576fd2b150)
